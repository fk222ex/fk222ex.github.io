This is a new page about me. 

My name is Freja, I'm from Alings√•s but have recently moved from Gothenburg to Kalmar. 

I've worked in a bookshop for over 11 years and I'm a serious book worm.

When I'm not sitting with my nose in a book I like spending time with my family. 

I absolutely hate the dark and cold and ask myself dayly why I choose to live in this godforsaken country!
