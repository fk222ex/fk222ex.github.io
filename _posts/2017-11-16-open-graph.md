Open Grap makes it possible to share content on social meadia in a controlled way. By adding special meta data to your content you can 'package' it into graph objects. 

There are four required properties: 
 * title
 * type
 * image
 * url

 There are a number of other properties that are optional, such as "audio" or "video" for example.
