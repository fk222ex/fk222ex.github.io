My over all inpression of static site generators is pretty positive. It allows you to very quickly get a complete web site that both functions well and looks good. In cases where you have no programming experience and aren't really interested in customizing your web site I think SSG's are perfect. You can just pick a theme and start filling it with content without having to learn how to actually code. But if you, on the other hand, want to customize it the possibilities are endless. It's still good to have a foundation to build on and not having to start from scratch but that also brings some complications. I thought it was very overwhelming at first, and even though I have a basic knowledge of html and css I found it hard to know how and, most importantly, where I should implement that in this new environment.
