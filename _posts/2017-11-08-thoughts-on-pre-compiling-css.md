I really like working with pre-compiled CSS. It's really like they said in the first lecture of this course: that the whole time you've been writing CSS before, in previous corses, you've thougt to yourself 'there has to be a better way!' and, evidentally, there is the better way and it's this.

I used Sass when pre-compiling the CSS. Compared to regular CSS pre-compiled CSS is more efficient when you want to change, update or support the style of the site since you, in most cases, only have to edit in one place. You also don't have to repeat yourself as much as you do when writing regular CSS.

That said, I thought it was a bit tricky figuring out where to find the coresponding code, especially when working with jekylls SSG where you haven't built everything from scratch yourself. Regular CSS may be messy but it's easier figuring out what's what.
