In theory i LOVE the idea of pre-compiling CSS. It's really like they said in the first lecture of this course: that the whole time I've been writing CSS before, in previous corses, I have thougt to myself 'there has to be a better way!' and this is the better way. That said, it's, as always, complicated to involve more things to learn, but over all I'm a fan.
